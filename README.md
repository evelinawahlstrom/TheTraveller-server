## What this project is about :woman_technologist: 

**OBS! IN PROGRESSS*

I am currently working on this project to showcase my skills on both frontend + backend, making a fullstack application.

I wanted to create a "instagram for travellers". I myself, love to travel and connect with new people. The thought is to show places a person been to through both images and also text, to tip fellow travellers on genuine experiences.
